1. Copy the relevant files like adbe.py and README.md from the parent adbe directory to adbe-enhanced/adbe
2. Modify the setup to update the version
3. `python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel`  # One time
4. `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` # Reference: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
   This should create dist directory.
5. # Probably not required at all, `python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine`  # One time
6. `python3 setup.py sdist upload`
5. Few mins later, check https://pypi.org/project/adb-enhanced/#history
